# Example HTTP APP

A service that will accept HTTP GET requests at:

`http://localhost:8080/hello`

and respond with:
```
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

Can read some text read out of a config file, showing the value is there to use:
`
http://localhost:8080/read
`

and respond with:
```
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

Can put some value into a database to show it can communicate with other containers:
`
http://localhost:8080/put?key=akey&val=avalue
`

and respond with:
```
{"id":1,"content":"Put avalue in akey"}
```

Can retrieve a value from a to show it can communicate with other containers. Will work even if container goes down because we are keeping the data in a volume.:
`
http://localhost:8080/get?key=akey
`
and respond with:
```
{"id":1,"content":"avalue"}
```
